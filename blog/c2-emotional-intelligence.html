        <h3>Search Inside Yourself Chapter 1 Reflection:</h3>

            <h3>What I learnt:</h3>
                <p>
                   In this chapter, mindfulness is defined as 
                    <b>The ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings and emotions,
                         to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's own
                          thinking and actions.
                    </b>
                <p>
                <p>
                    For me, this chapter made it clear how useful mindfulness and emotional intelligence could be in every day life,
                    and how it could help me navigate tricky situations, both in a work environment and at home.
                    I have always been someone who prefers harmony over conflict, and after reading this chapter,
                    I am convinced that mindfulness can help me to create more conditions for harmony even in tense situations.
                <p>
                <p>
                    I am also excited by the prospects of the benefits of emotional intelligence, particularly Stellar Work Performance.
                    It was interesting to see that out of the top six competencies for people in the tech sector, 4 out of the 6 were emotional competencies.
                    It would be great to have increased self confidence and more initiative in taking on challenges.
                <p>
           
            <h3>How I found the 2min of Mindfulness:</h3>
                <p>
                   I found that time went by surprisingly fast. As I made my mind quiet, it's like there was space made for my emotions and the thing's
                   I'm worried about to come to the forefront of my attention. As I am someone who is often out of touch with how I am feeling, and what is bothering me,
                   I found this useful. I then tried to bring my attention back to my breathing, and that worked. I spent the last while visualising a butterfly on a flax leaf, with
                   the flax rising up and down in time with my breath. That was peaceful. I look forward to trying it for longer periods of time.
