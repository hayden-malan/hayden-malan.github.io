                <h3>
                    What I learnt from the Mindfulness Conversation: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    I was nervous at first, but during it I found it really nice to be able to listen to my
                    friend. I realised that I hadn't properly spoken to someone in this sort of way in such 
                    a long time. It was a really great bonding experience, and I would do it again. 
                    The other person found it very good, and says they feel like they got a deeper understanding and
                    connection with me, and that it strengthened our friendship.     
                    
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    Techniques I will use to sustain my practice:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    Two techniques I will be continuing daily are <b>do less than you
                         can</b> and <b>one breath a day</b>. These stood out to me as helpful for me because they
                         aren't too overwhelming, and don't feel like a big commitment that I will soon lose track of.
                         I like the idea that I can generate an intention to do something kind and beneficial for myself
                         each day, and over time that self directed kindness can become easier, which will help make
                         mindfulness easier too.    
                            
                    </p>

                    Other Musings:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                     I was really pleasantly surprised by the mindfulness conversation, and I infact tried it out again
                     later in the week, during a very tense situation where I had to have a seriou discussion with my parents,
                     and it went so much better than I thought it would. I am pleased that this book is already starting to
                     have a positive impact on my life.
