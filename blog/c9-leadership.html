                <h3>
                       My experience of leadership: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        In recent times I can think of 2 people who have been compassionate leaders in my life. The first was a psychiatrist, who's actual job
                        was to help me. But nowhere in his job description did it say he had to lead me, or inspire me to change my life. But he did, and I really 
                        admire him and how kind he is to go above and beyond his job description. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think of him as a compassionate leader because firstly, he took the time to really listen and try to understand my situation. Secondly,he  
                        had empathy for my situation. Not sympathy, which is common and of very little use, but empathy, which helped me to feel better about myself and 
                        how I was handling my situation. Lastly and most importantly, he did not lead me by giving me strict orders to follow, he actually encouraged me and 
                        believed in me, and eventually ended up motivating me to be the leader of my own life, and motivating me to solve my own situation without much of his help.
                        He didn't have to do this, he could have just prescribed me medication or told me the same thing that any other medical professional tells a patient, to wait 
                        things out, that perhaps things will change, or to just listen to the advice of the professionals. But he didn't, he instead helped make a huge
                        difference in my life. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second person I think of as a compassionate leader in my life would be an old coworker of mine. I was very new to the job, so he was assigned my supervisor.
                        He had many years of experience, and therefore he was responsible too for my work and for teaching me how to do my job properly. It was a stressful 
                        job, in a career where social skills and kindness aren't exactly prioritised at all. On top of that, I was a woman in a career that is made up of 1 percent women.
                        Despite all of this, he treated me with respect and kindness, and as a complete equal. He taught me in the way one would teach a friend how to do something.
                        Not only that, but when I had doubts about my own abilities, he would believe in me more than I believed in myself, and encourage me to work hard and to 
                        grow. I learnt so, so much from him and it was really good working with him. He was also a cheerful guy, and very talkative, so even on days where the job was rough
                        and there was a lot going wrong, he would make work a better place to be just by being there. If he ever started his own company I would gladly go work for him.

                <h3>
                    Multiplying Goodness:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                       I thoroughly enjoyed the multiplying goodness meditation. I am a pessimist by nature, so I am so quick to get bogged down by all of the struggling
                       and sadness in life. I often forget to take the time to think of the good qualities in myself, others and the world around me. During this meditation, 
                        I felt very happy and at peace, and even though I was only visualising this breathing in and out of light, it really felt like I was making a difference
                        to the world somehow. I am not religious, but I think this might be the closest I've come to understanding why people pray. If I were to pray I guess it would
                        be to send out good intentions to the world, and then to gather the good intentions of the world, and to repeat that process.

                <h3>
                    Tonglen Meditation:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        I found the Tonglen meditation tricky. I usually calm myself down by imagining I am breathing out toxins and breathing in joy and light, 
                        but in this exercise I was challenged to do the opposite. In doing so I reached a moment where I realised that I by default view
                        myself as a consumer of good resources and a creator of negative energy. This isn't a very positive way to view myself. When doing this meditation
                        I was able to shift from that view of myself to a new view, where I can acknowledge that there is suffering around me, and that I can help take 
                        in that suffering and actually have a positive impact on the world around me, rather than hoarding any positive energy that comes my way.

                    SCARF Model:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Status: So far in phase 0 I have felt a bit like I know nothing and people generally do know more than me. It has 
                            improved because I have improved compared to how little I used to know, but hopefully in bootcamp I will be less quick
                            to assume that I have a low place on ladder of tech knowledge.
                        <li>Certainty: Haha this is a tricky one. There has been very little certainty about phase zero and doing phase zero for me. 
                            It has been very stressful and I have often tried to ignore the fact that I am super stressed, which makes it worse.
                            Hopefully over the course of bootcamp I can feel more reassured about my future, or at least become okay with the uncertainty
                            of it all.
                        <li>Autonomy: I think this has been limited for me in phase zero by the drastic time restrictions in my particular situation. I
                            have felt like I had to just pump out work productively rather than really deeply studying it as much as I would have wanted to.
                            I hope in bootcamp that although it will be busy, I will feel more in control of what work I am doing, and what work I can allow 
                            myself the time to do, rather than feeling like I am constantly at the mercy of deadlines.
                        <li>Relatedness: This has been 50/50 for me during phase 0, as I am naturally a bit of a nervous and apprehensive person when it comes
                            to anything social. Especially in this case, I feel a bit intimidated by how cool everyone is! But, I have been amazed so far by 
                            everyone's kindness and helpfulness, and I predict that during bootcamp I will make some friends and feel quite connected to the group.
                            I personally believe that struggling together is a hundred times easier than struggling alone. 
                        <li>Fairness: So far fairness hasn't played that much of a role for me during phase zero simply because it hasn't been an issue. I have always
                            felt respected in the group, and all interactions I have seen and taken part in were fair. I hope this continues during bootcamp, and that
                            I am able to take that external fairness and find ways to be more kind to myself and treat myself more fairly.

               Difficult conversation:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I had a really difficult conversation recently in which I came out to my parents as female to male transgender. This was 
                    something that I had wanted to talk to them about for years but felt too scared to even mention because I was 
                    assuming they would have a negative response. I prepared with a letter, and I waited till a moment when I thought that they 
                    were in a good space and I was too. Instead of handing them the letter, I read it to them, explaining in great detail how I have
                    always felt more comfortable as a guy. It was very tricky, and emotional, but they completely positively reacted and accepted me.
                    Even wrote my preferred name on my christmas presents. This was truly amazing for me, and I am so happy that I had the courage to speak 
                    up, regardless of how the conversation may have turned out. If it's important enough, sometimes I just have to go for it.
