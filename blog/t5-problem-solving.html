                    Two stories about problem solving: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                            
                            
                            <b>The other day I got blocked on a simple problem.</b>
                            I was working on sprint 3, my blog's skeleton css,
                            trying to implement the grid structure for my blog,
                            in a way that was both responsive and functional.
                            The problem was, no matter what part of my code I changed,
                            reworked, deleted, or completely rebuilt, I couldn't get
                            my grid to work.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                            So, after trying for hours and hours, 
                            I asked the slackchat for help. Brian H tried to help me 
                            troubleshoot what could be wrong. we considered multiple options
                            to do with my css, and eventually he suggested I look at my browser settings.
                            Finally, I realised that this whole time, my browser had been zoomed in to 
                            200%, so there actually wasn't anything wrong with my code, and everything worked fine.
                     </p>        
                    <p>       
                            Unfortunately, I didn't realise this until after I had already completely deleted all of my
                            code. So I had to start over regardless. During the process I felt very stressed out, frustrated,
                            curious, and then quite mad when I realised what was wrong, but eventually relieved.
                            The BIG thing I learnt was to start troubleshooting by checking the basic, basic things, that seem
                            almost too simple and silly to bother checking. Especially browser settings! test the code on a variety of
                            devices.

                        <b>A while ago, I solved a problem in an elegant way.</b>
                         My problem was that I could not clone my copy of the cohort repository.
                        First, I checked if there was anything wrong with the way I was using the git bash terminal.
                        Since I am a beginner, I thought it would be highly likely that I had made some kind of error when
                        attempting to clone the repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Then, I reached out to the slackchat for help. Some other people
                        said that they had also struggled to clone the repository, so I felt better knowing it wasn't just me.
                        I googled a few terms including 'error with cloning git repository' and then googled the specific error
                        message that git returned when attempting to clone the repository. Eventually, between the help from the 
                        slackchat and the forums I found through google, I was able to determine that the reason git was refusing 
                        to clone the repository was because Windows was not accepting some very long file names inside the repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        I then solved the problem by reaching out to the owners of the files on slackchat, asking them to rename to
                        shorter filenames. I ended up being able to succesfully download the repository. Throughout the process I felt
                        a bit nervous and curious,  but I felt happy and relieved and a burst of success when I was able to solve the problem.
                        I learnt about the importance of filenames, and certain issues that could be encountered when windows sees certain characters
                        or long filenames when trying to clone git repositories.

                    <p>
                            Here are some JS functions: 
                    </p>        
                    <ul> 
                        <li>       <b>.map()</b>: This function uses information about an existing array to create a new array. it does this by 
                                    applying a certain argument to each item in the existing array, and then taking the result of that and adding it
                                    to the new array, until an entirely new array is built.

                        <li>     <b>.filter()</b>:This function will check if every element is true or false, using a certain criteria.
                            Any element identified as true will be saved to a new array, which will be returned.

                        <li>     <b>.reduce()</b>:This can combine the values of several elements into one value, which is useful in a mathematical context,
                                and also if you wish to return a tally of the amount of instances of a certain piece of data within an array.

                            So far I feel confident using the following techniques:
