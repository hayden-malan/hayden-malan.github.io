                <h3>
                    JavaScript VS. HTML and CSS: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        HTML is used to make the page, by setting up the content and structure of the page through use of elements. 
                        CSS covers every aspect of how the page looks, and adds on to the html by enhancing different elements
                         to have certain properties like colours.
                        JavaScript, however, is less about what is on the page and more about what goes on behind the scenes. 
                        It's what controls how certain interactive or functional elements on the page work. Javascript is important,
                        because making a webpage that has built-in interactivity and functions can incredibly enhance the user experience.
                         
                    
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    Control Flow & Loops:
                </h3>
                    <p> 
                        Control Flow is a dynamic decision making process, similar to a flowchart quiz. A question, or scenario is given, and your answer will dictate what happens next. 
                        These can be yes/no questions, or scenarios where you can answer with a number of different answers, like a multi-choice question.  
                        This Control Flow Process when used in JavaScript can help to identify specific outcomes to display based on different scenarios when using the same or similar variables.

                        A loop is more of a cycle that repeats. I personally have a water bottle loop in my life.
                        If my waterbottle is full, I will drink some causing it to be half full, if the waterbottle is half full,
                        I will drink some more until it is empty, and if the waterbottle is empty, I will have to go fill
                        it up. Once the waterbottle is full again, the loop resets and it's only a matter
                        of time before it is empty, and I will have to refill it. In JavaScript , my waterbottle loop would check
                        the status of the bottle and then return the appropriate action for me to take.

                <h3>
                    Accessing Data; Arrays VS. Objects: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Arrays remind me of going to Maccas. Here's how:
                        After you place your order, you are given a number. They don't ask for your name, just give you a number. 
                        So you are now number 474 waiting for "chickenNuggets". You won't be getting those nuggets until 
                        number 473 has gotten their "frozenCoke" and number 475 will have to wait till after you for their
                        "bigMac". To translate this scenario into Javascript, I'll need to change my order number to 1.
                        the person who ordered the "frozenCoke" is 0 and the person waiting for the "bigMac" is 2. 
                        in JS this array would look like this: var myArray = ["frozenCoke", "chickenNuggets", "bigMac"]; 
                        To access any of the orders, or the strings in this array, I would have to refer back to our order numbers.
                        In all arrays in JS, these start from 0 and increase by 1. So, if I wanted to select my order, I would access
                        it by referring to it as myArray[0]
                    </p>    
                    <p>  
                        Objects are easier to explain by using the example of creating a fan page for your favourite celebrity.
                        You'd have your headings like: "name", "birthday", "profession", "favouriteColour", "randomFact"
                        and then you'd have the content under those headings: "Jane Doe", "Tenth July", "musician", "blue", "loves cats"
                        These two different sets of information only mean something when they are linked together in pairs. The one list is 
                        there to identify the other list, like a key, and the other list is a set of values assigned to the first list.
                        This is called a key-value pair. The order of the pairs in an object isn't important.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To access an element in an object, we just need to refer to the key (name) of an element.
                        So, if we wanted to access a specific fact about our favourite celebrity, we could call on
                        the key. Like, if you wanted the celebrity's name, you could use celebrity.name and the console would return "Jane Doe"   
                               
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    Functions:   
                </h3>
                    <p>
                         Functions are names for groups of smaller actions or steps that work together to achieve an outcome. A microwave has functions.
                         If you want it to defrost something, that is a specific function. Whereas if you just wanted to warm up some rice for 2
                         minutes on high, that would be a different function. If you press the 'defrost' button, your microwave will start a group of
                         smaller actions, like setting the heat to low, setting the time to 10 minutes, and then after ten minutes making a 'bing' noise.
                         These actions it would be different if you pressed the 'quick start' button after putting in your rice, because that would kickstart a different function. 
                        Just like you don't need to be involved in every single small action your microwave takes to heat up your rice, you also don't need to know everything
                        about a certain function to know how to use it in JavaScript. All you need, is the name of the function. In the case of the microwave,
                        you need to know to press the 'quick start' button. In javaScript, it would look like this: quickStart(), and you could use it to call on that group of smaller
                        actions, in all sorts of contexts.
