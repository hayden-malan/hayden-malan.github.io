                    Process Over Product:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        When I was redesigning and rebuilding this site, process over product helped me to
                        handle my stress when things went wrong. I spent a really large amount of times sifting
                        through my code, trying to find what the issue was that was causing my website to malfunction.
                        Ordinarily I would have been upset about this time that I spent, as it didn't really add any value to the outcome of the site,
                        but looking back on it now, this time was hugely beneficial because it helped me build my problem solving and troubleshooting skills,
                        which I will definitely be using often in future.

                    Views on Meditation Before Chapter 2:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Before reading this chapter, I had already been exposed to a lot of meditation, and buddhist philosophy. My father is always meditating, and
                        I went with him once to go listen to a Bodhisattva speak about what meditation is, and how anyone can try it and experience improvements in their life.
                        Mostly I knew it's a lot about breathing, and sending out your good intentions to the world.

                <h3>
                    What I've learnt about meditation:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                      This chapter strongly links mindfulness to the meditation process, talking about how meditation develops not only
                      <b>attention</b> but also <b>meta-attention</b> which I found interesting. I wasn't aware of the way meditation could benefit 
                      one's concentration. It also interested me to learn about the medical healing affects of meditation documented in studies about
                      psoriasis. As someone who has sensitive skin myself, I'm hoping some meditation could help me with that too.

                <h3>
                    Techniques that stood out to me:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                       The 4th step of the "4 step plan to deal with distractions" <b>Let It Go</b> stood out to me, because in my previous meditation endeavours,
                       I had been under the impression that one must push away all distractions, and chase them out of your mind as soon as you notice them. 
                       On the contrary, this chapter says "Letting go is an invitation." and suggests that if a certain thought or feeling or distraction doesn't 
                       accept the invitation to go away, then one must treat that with kindness and allow it to stay until it naturally goes away. I found this 
                       helpful, and this helped me to be more relaxed during meditation and not so caught up in getting rid of distractions.
