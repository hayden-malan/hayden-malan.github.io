                    Mindfulness and Self Awareness: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                     I think self awareness is about applying mindfulness techniques while observing yourself, your emotions, and your actions.
                     Self awareness is about knowing yourself, and I think it's relationship to mindfulness is that mindfulness is a really good
                     way to gain insights about things and to study them with clarity. So, if one applies mindfulness while studying oneself, I think
                     that will lead to self awareness.

                <h3>
                    Self Awareness Practice:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                            I tried the body scan practice from this chapter. I had a bit of a strange experience. I noticed that I found it
                            particularly challenging to focus on my body , especially my face and chest. I think this is perhaps because I have
                            struggled in the past, and still struggle with, dissociation which was previously used as a coping method but still 
                            lingers and affects my life today. I found it easier to focus on parts of my body where there was pain, and also on 
                            my hands which were physically holding something. This exercise also helped me to realise that I spend so much of my 
                            daily life focusing on the world around me (Search Outside Myself, so to speak) and that focusing on my body more often
                            would probably benefit me a lot in the long run. When it was time to focus on the positive memory, it felt relaxing and
                            pleasant to remember how nice the memory was and how good it felt. I would still like to try the journalling at some point in the future.

                <h3>
                        My Emotions are Not Me:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    What I found most meaningful from this section was the metaphor likening a negative emotion to a pain in one's shoulders. It hurts now, but eventually 
                    it will go away. I can ignore it and go eat icecream and in a while it will be gone. I found this approach to negative emotions to be quite helpful, 
                    because often when I am experiencing strong negative emotions it is hard to find perspective, and I can sometimes feel quite helpless and trapped. In futureI will
                    try to think of my emotions more as something my body is experiencing and less as something I'm stuck in.
