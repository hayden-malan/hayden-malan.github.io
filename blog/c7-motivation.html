                <h3>
                        The Pleasure, Passion and Purpose lens: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    I am unsure of how life looks through this lens, I don't wear these glasses very often! I am by nature a troubleshooter and a bit pessimistic,
                    so I'm often living a very different life with very different sets of glasses on, often heavily tinted sunglasses, blocking out all the light.
<br><br>
                    I could try to imagine though, pleasure lenses being golden and sparkly, and that life would look like a desert with the occasional oasis of Pleasure
                    to run to, and then again the frantic search would be on, until more pleasure was spotted. 
                    Passion lenses would put everything into more focus, higher resolution. Especially the thing one is passionate about. This could distort the world a bit.
                    I have no idea what the purpose lens would look like! I am intrigued to find out. I guess everything you see would be all interconected with silvery
                    strings, tying it back to your greater purpose and therefore making things all link together so that nothing ever seems meaningless.

                <h3>
                        Discovering Values and Higher Purpose:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My core values are:
                </p>
                      <ul>
                           <li><b>Humor:</b> This is what makes life worth living for me. 
                            It is an endless source of joy even on days where everything seems
                             to be going wrong.
                           <li><b>Peace:</b> I value peace because applying it to every action one
                            takes I find is very beneficial, it makes actions more smooth and effective,
                            as well as spreading positive energy.    
                           <li><b>Integrity:</b> I am at my best when I am speaking my truth and living 
                            an authentic life. Similarly I work best in teams where there is trust and honesty,
                            where people can be open about their struggles and successes without being judged.
                       </ul>   
                   
                   </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>I stand for:</b>  
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li><b>Equality:</b> I stand for the equal treatment and respect of all people.
                                It is incredibly important to me that each individual is given opportunities
                                based on their skills rather than their race, gender, or any other thing about
                                themselves that they are not in control of. 

                            <li><b>Knowledge:</b> I stand for the spreading of knowledge to as many people as possible,
                                because I believe education is essential to building a better society, where people are 
                                more informed and can therefore make better choices, and have more opportunities.

                            <li><b>Acceptance:</b> I stand for the acceptance of all people, because I believe that 
                                by accepting one another for who we are, we can spread kindness and alleviate insecurity
                                and suffering, especially amongst young people today. I think being accepted is something
                                that people might take for granted, and for those who aren't accepted right now, could truly
                                be life changing and even a life saver.
