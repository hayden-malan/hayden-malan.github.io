                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Tat, I am 18 and I am currently partaking in phase 0 at Enspiral Dev Academy.
                        I'm still a novice to software development, I really enjoy working with front end, and I hope
                        I can make this blog look super cool.
                    
                    </p>

                </h3>
                    <p>
                        When I am not working on projects, I like to go for long walks on the beach, play guitar,
                        and listen to music. A few of my favourite authors are Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams, 
                        and Derek Landy. I'm currently watching Stranger Things Season 2, please don't share any
                        spoilers!

                    My Background:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                      I moved to New Zealand from South Africa in 2012, went to college at Chilton St. James School
                      and then at Newlands College, left school when I was midway through Year 12, earned my National
                      Certificate of Electrical Engineering from Whitireia, worked as a Checkout Operator and then
                      as an Electrical Apprentice, and then quit my job to take this course.  
                    
                    </p> 
                <h3>
                    Future Goals and Dreams:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                       When I am finished with this course, my goal is to be knowledgeable when it comes to html,
                        css and javascript, and to be able to apply for an entry level job somewhere as a web developer. 
                        One day, it is my dream to live in a small house by the sea, and to invent an app or website that
                         will be able to help people with their every-day lives in some way.
