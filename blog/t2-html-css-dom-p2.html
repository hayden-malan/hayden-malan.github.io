  <h4>What I've Learnt from Udacity about HTML,CSS and the DOM</h4>

  
  <ul>
      <li> <b>Grid Based Design</b> is when you divide up your website using a series of invisible horizontal and verticle lines, which forms a grid, leaving you with a number of columns and rows that interact with one another in a way that looks neat, and is less tedious to implement (through use of <b>frameworks</b>) than it would be to design each box with certain specifications to make them all fit together.
      <li> <b>Responsive Webpages</b> are important because more and more people are using phones, tablets and other devices to access the internet, or computers with different screen resolutions than ours. Responsive design allows us to cater for screens of all resolutions, making the webpages scaleable so that they are more accessible to devices of all screen resolutions. This is through use of "max-width" "viewport" and using percentages rather than pixels to determine the scale of elements.
         Generally speaking, the amount of people who can view and use your website is rather important to people who make websites, and the clients they make it for, so having the ability to make that number of people larger is invaluable.
      <li> <b>Semantic Structure </b> is when you use specific tags like <h1> , <h2> and <img> to specifically define certain elements on the page, and to style them accordingly, also using your rows and columns to control where they are situated on the page, and how much of the page they occupy. It is good to use semantic tags because they are easy to understand for both humans and computers.
     <li> <b>A part of the lesson</b> that I found interesting and useful was when they used a lego structure to show how columns work, by making a mockup of a website completely out of lego. I have a lot of lego at home, and would love to try making a mockup of my blog with it sometime. It really helped me understand how flexible grid based design can be.
 </ul>

 <p><b></b>Overall, the second lesson on Udacity has gotten me excited to implement <img class="spiderman" src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/059/601/spiderman116_spideydancing1.gif" alt="This will display an animated GIF" > a grid based structure on my blog.</b></p>
