<h4>Some Thoughts After Reading About Habit Techniques</h4>

<ul>
    <li>  I tried the <b>Seven Counterintuitive Ways To Be Insanely Productive</b> methods, and the <b>Flow</b> method
    <li> <b>I found it interesting</b> that Flow is linked to intrinsic rewards, that we can program into our bodies over time, and that one of the Seven Ways was to put Flow before Patterns. As someone who's productivity levels naturally rise and fall based on my interest levels and my circumstances, I appreciated knowing that this doesn't have to be a bad thing, and that I can streamline my work schedule by embracing it.
    <li> <b>What worked for me </b> was really embracing not having a constant expectation of steady productivity, and instead allowing for hours of less productivity and hours where productivity spiked, without feeling forced to produce a certain amount of work per hour.
    <li> <b>I'll Experiment Further With</b> both the Seven Ways and the general concept of Flow. It would be to see the long term improvements they can make to my work habits.
    <li> I am <b>excited</b>, and <b>nervous</b> to learn in this environment, but it's all helping me to stay  productive, so I don't worry about being nervous.
</ul>

<p>here is a link to the Seven Ways article, I enjoyed how it was written and the fresh perspective it had.
