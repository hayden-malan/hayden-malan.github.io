                        Trust and sincerity: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                       I have tried using some of the techniques including mindful listening, and asking open ended questions. 
                       Establishing trust is really hard for me, it is something I struggle with because some people have taken advantage
                       of my trust and vulnerability in the past, and this has been rather harmful for me. It led to conflict that was not productive,
                       and feedback based off of personal attacks rather than Actionable, Kind, Specific feedback. So now I am not someone who wants to open
                       up to people, or to trust people. I hope that over time that will change, and that I can start to develop better mental habits and give 
                       more people the benefit of the doubt.
                    </p>

                        Empathetic listening:
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                           I did the formal empathetic listening exercise with my grandmother. It went surprisingly well. When it was my turn to speak,
                           I spoke about a topic that was deeply personal to me, and that I wouldn't have otherwise shared, but I felt very safe to do that.
                           What surprised me is the amount of emotion I ended up expressing. I didn't even know I was that emotional about that topic. When
                           it was her turn to speak, despite being really nervous at the start, she gained courage and ended up speaking for longer than the 
                           three minutes. She got some stuff off of her chest that she had been needing to say for a long time. The conversation ended up being 
                           rather constructive, and we even ended up talking about some possible solutions to some issues that had been around for quite some time.
                           Overall we found the exercise really helpful, and enjoyable. We have decided to do it regularly , because we found it so constructive.

                <h3>
                    Loving Kindness Meditation:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The loving kindness meditation was interesting to me. I didn't expect the results to be so immediate. I 
                noticed that when I was thinking of someone that I was fond of, I was able to be grateful for that person, and to 
                realise how much I had actually been taking that person for granted in my life. It felt good to appreciate my friends.
                Contrastingly, when I was thinking of someone who I had not seen eye to eye with, it was also soothing to think of this person
                in a different light, and to acknowledge that this person also has struggles like me, and it felt like a weight off my shoulders
                to wish them well and hope that they can find happiness too. Overall, a very positive experience.            
             </p>
                     

                <h3>
                Political awareness:
                </h3>
                <p>
                   The difficult situation from my past where there was conflict is a couple of months ago, me and someone else were arguing 
                   about my future, and about the suitability of this course for me, and whether or not I would succeed as a web developer,
                   and whether or not this was the right way to go about things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Assuming I am 100 percent reasonable and correct: I am taking on this course, because I have done my research and I have decided 
                  by looking at the evidence that this will be a good course for me to take, and a practical way for me to learn how to be a software developer, 
                  more specifically a web developer. I believe I will succeed because I am a very hard worker, quite driven, and determined to do the very 
                  best and to go beyond expectations. I think this is a good fit for me because I enjoy coding, I enjoy learning about it, I am creative and I 
                  like working in teams. I think that this course isn't out of my league, and I think I have proved that by meeting the phase 0 work with 
                  effort, kindness and integrity, even in the very reduced timeframe that I was expected to do it in.
                   
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Although I can acknowledge that this other person has had more experience in the IT field than me, it is my opinion that this person is biased 
                    against me, and holds negative prejudice towards me and that this person habitually underestimates me and what I am capable of.
                    I also think this person is stuck in the past, and does not think that this is a feasible way for me to learn because it is not the way that 
                    they learnt.   
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    I am sure that this course is my best option, because I have looked into other options such as university, which would be too costly and time 
                    consuming, with very little promise of employment at the end of it, not to mention I have no idea what I would study. I have also considered 
                    working as an electrical apprentice, and I have tried it, and it is not to my liking, as it is physically exhausting and one does not get paid very
                    well. It's not a fulfilling job. All the other jobs I am able to apply for at the moment are similarly unappealing and wouldn't work in the long term.
                    Since I don't think uni is the right thing for me, or employment, that leaves only this course, or self directed study. I chose this course because
                    it seems like there is more evidence to suggest that this will be able to get me a job, rather than me teaching myself, which I have no data to 
                    make a prediction about.    
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    OK so presuming the other person is 100 percent correct and reasonable: This course is not suitable for me because I am too young and inexperienced 
                    to be able to handle the workload and grasp some of the more complex aspects of the course. Not only that, but the course is a costly investment to make
                    when I am not even sure that this is what I would want to do for the rest of my life. This course may seem like it holds all of the answers, but the world of 
                    IT is much more vast and complex than one bootcamp can ever teach someone, and the idea of gaining employment in the sector simply because of 3 months of coding
                    is highly unlikely. This person would argue that they have spent over 25 years working in IT, and that they know far more than me in all possible ways, and that 
                    the work they do would have to be learnt over decades, through intense self directed study, as well as studying computer science, as well as practical experience of
                    working on thousands of projects. Learning a much larger amount of languages. Putting in way more hard work over a much longer period of time, and then only maybe will
                    one get employed. In summary, me taking this course will be a horrible disaster and a complete waste of time, as I am completely incompetent and way below the entry 
                    level of skill required to find this course useful or conduitive to starting employment in IT. I am too young, too inexperienced, and everything I think I know is false.
