                    The EDA Experience So Far:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                     I've had a highly positive experience so far. I really enjoy the teamwork and emotional
                      intelligence aspect, and I am excited about the prospect of becoming excellent at web
                       development and looking for a job.
                    
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    What I took away from Shereef's video:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                         What I took away from Shereef's video was the importance of the
                          <b>Kitchen Mindset</b>, the feeling of being in charge of creating the work,
                           and being able to actively participate throughthe ups and downs, the fun
                            parts and the disasters.

                <h3>
                    How I see myself engaging in EDA culture:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        I might be shy at first, but I think it is a supportive space for new learning and growth.
                        At every corner I expect I'll face a lot of challenges, but I hope to meet them head on with
                        integrity, kindness and lots of effort. A big motto of mine is to never give up.
                    
                    </p> 
                <h3>
                    My expectations of EDA:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        They have definitely changed. I thought it would be a lot more serious, and I was cynical
                         about the teamwork side, but now that I've started I can see it really works.     
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    How I feel about the learning environment:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                         I am <b>excited</b>, and <b>nervous</b> to learn in this environment, but it's all
                         helping me to stay  productive, so I don't worry about being nervous. I often find myself 
                         completely losing track of time, and getting very absorbed in the work. It's only phase 0, 
                         so I don't know yet how I'll react to the bootcamp campus learning environment, but I have
                         positive hopes about it.
