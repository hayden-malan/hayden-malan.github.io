        <h3>Some Thoughts After Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat:</h3>
        
            <h3>The EDA Experience So Far:</h3>
                <p>My take on the EDA experience so far is highly positive. It seems almost too good to be true. What I was daydreaming about when stuck in exam rooms or on the construction site. It's being able to grow your own knowledge, work in a kind and helpful team of people who are just as dedicated as you are, and still be able to get a job after.

            <h3>What I took away from Shereef's video:</h3>
                <p>What I took away from Shereef's video was the importance of the <b>Kitchen Mindset</b>, the feeling of being in charge of creating the work, and being able to actively participate throughthe ups and downs, the fun parts and the disasters.
            
            <h3>How I see myself engaging in EDA culture: </h3>
                <p> I might be shy at first, but I think it is a supportive space for new learning and growth.

            <h3>My expectations of EDA:</h3>
                <p>They have definitely changed. I thought it would be a lot more serious, and I was cynical about the teamwork side, but now that I've started I can see it really works.
          
           <h3>How I feel about the learning environment:</h3>
               <p>I am <b>excited</b>, and <b>nervous</b> to learn in this environment, but it's all helping me to stay  productive, so I don't worry about being nervous.
