                   Responsive sites: 
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        A responsive site is a site in which the content will change size, or change in other ways,
                        depending on the size of the screen. For example, if the site uses a 12x12 grid for the width of
                        most desktop computers, when the size of the screen changes to be much smaller, say the size of a mobile phone,
                        a responsive site will then collapse that grid and alter the display of the content to optimize it for the viewer
                        on a smaller screen. Responsiveness is important because more and more people across the globe are accessing the internet
                        on smaller devices, and on a variety of different screen sizes. It is best to make your site accessible to all these people.
                    
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    Mobile first design:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile first design is when you design a site with mobile in mind first of all. This is important because it is
                        generally harder to cater your site towards a mobile screen, as there is less space and the configuration of the site
                        cannot be as you might have conventionally imagined it would be on a desktop. If you start with mobile in mind first, make it look
                        good on a small screen, then scaling up the screen will leave you with more space, and you can then decide what to implement on your desktop site.
                        It's easier than the reverse scenario, where you design all these elements for a desktop site, which then get crammed onto mobile and leave you uncertain which elements to sacrifice.

                    <h3>
                        Frameworks:
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            Frameworks are CSS file structures that can define the look of multiple webpages. 
                            For example, this page you are reading now uses Skeleton css frameworks as well
                            as a custom css file that work in conjunction with one another to determine how 
                            this page and every other page on this blog looks.
                        </p>

                    <h4>Pro's of frameworks:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Saves time, because you can style multiple pages with the same css files
                            <li>Gives a uniform look to your site because the same css files control how your pages look.
                            <li>The grid helps to give your pages structure, and makes them easier to read and understand.
                        </ul>

                    <h4>Con's of frameworks:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Making a small change in the css could affect your entire site, across all pages.
                            <li>You need to keep tabs on any links to remote css, or css bootstraps, to make sure that changes haven't been made.
                            <li>It is tricky to do something unique and different with an altered page structure on a specific page, you have to add it to your custom css which could take time.
                        </ul>

                    Wireframes:
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        A wireframe is a tool used to make a mockup of a website. Usually quite plain and basic, laying out
                        in boxes all the different elements you wish to include on the site, and how you want them positioned
                        relative to one another.  This is done by creating a page that looks how you want the page on the site
                        to look when it is finished.
                    </p> 
                    <p>   
                        Wireframes can be drawn
                        up on paper like mine, or made using online tools or computer programs. We use wireframes when we 
                        are designing websites because it helps us to plan what we need to achieve with our coding, and also
                        helps us to determine the specifications of the finished site, and thus can help us set our goals.
                               
                    </p>

                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            Some aspects of my wireframes include my nav bar at the top of my blog pages, my logo at the top right
                             of my index page, and my icons on my index page with links to each blog. These particular aspects were not
                             tricky to implement, but that is because this is actually my second set of wireframes. My first set had sort of
                             impossible type expectations, that would not work well with Skeleton CSS and wouldn't be responsive.
