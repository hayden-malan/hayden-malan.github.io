  <h4>What I've Learnt from Udacity about HTML,CSS and the DOM</h4>

  
  <ul>
      <li> <b>An Analogy To Describe HTML, CSS and the DOM:</b> If your website is a house, your HTML files are the structure, like the walls, which room is which.
         CSS files are the style of your house, like the color of the walls, what decorations you have.
         JavaScript files are functional things that do certain tasks, like your garage door opener, or your television remote.  
      <li> <b>Boxifying Design</b> is very much what it sounds like. Everything is a box. Even if it doesn't look rectangular, it will be seen as a box on your website, and can be manipulated as such when you are coding your website.
      <li> <b>The Box Model </b> is what the boxes are made of. This includes the content, padding, border and margin. The border is the edge of the box, the content is what's inside,the padding is like a cushion around the content, and the margin is like a cushion around the box that pushes it away from other things. 
 </ul>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><b></b>Overall, I enjoyed the first lesson on Udacity and I'm excited to keep learning more and improving my blog as I go along.</b></p>
